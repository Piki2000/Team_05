## Vision
- 10% of all cats are overweight, of those 40% are even obese.
- Gradual weight loss is important to avoid health issues like liver disease.
- Users can enter the cats data like weight and size so the app can calculate the recommended amount of food.
- Daily reminder and tracker of different kinds of cat food (wet, dry, snack, ...).
- Users can take photos to create cool timelapse for social media and to share progress with friends.
